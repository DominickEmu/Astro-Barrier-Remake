A remake of a game from the Club Penguin minigame library, recreated and remastered in Godot. Developed throughout Fall, and officially published in December 2024.

Controls (PC):

    A/D = Move the ship left/right
    Left Click = Shoot

Controls (Mobile):

    Buttons = Move
    Tap on top half of screen = Shoot

Goal: Shoot all targets on the screen. More points are awarded for using less lasers. Using all your lasers will use one of your lives and restart the level.

Blue targets, when shot first, give an extra life.

Orange switches remove orange blocks.

There are 21 levels in total. The first half are similar to the original, the others are my own machinations.
